You can fine **live** versions of the notebooks running on Microsoft Azure at [https://notebooks.azure.com/douglasastarnes/libraries/tcmem17](https://notebooks.azure.com/douglasastarnes/libraries/tcmem17).  All you need to sign in is a Microsoft account (ie. outlook.com email) and the clone the library at the link.  And yes, it's **FREE**!

If you want your own installation there are several ways to get it.

First Anaconda is an excellent open source and cross platform data science distribution.  There are installers for Python 2 and Python 3 for Windows, macOS and Linux.  These can be found at: [https://www.anaconda.com/download/](https://www.anaconda.com/download/).

If you prefer not to have to install anything locally (Anaconda works best on some systems when it is the default version of Python) you can find several excellent up to date Docker containers on Docker Hub.  I would recommend these to start:
* [Anaconda Offical (includes Jupyter notebook)](https://hub.docker.com/r/continuumio/anaconda3/)
* [Jupyter Notebook Data Science (includes the required Python packages)](https://hub.docker.com/r/jupyter/datascience-notebook/)
